# MyBodyMyHealth

My Body My Health is a full stack web application that assists users in tracking their menstrual cycles and their contracpetive use. In this application, I utilize the PERN stack, which includes PostgreSQL, Express, React, and NodeJS, with the help of Sequelize, Bcrypt, SCSS, and Axios. I use a custom RESTful API to perform standard CRUD operations and also make Axios requests to a Health.gov external API to retrieve verified health resources for user exploration.
